# I wish I liked reading docs more

It's an art to write good documentation and I don't like how Python projects in
general do it. But that's a me problem. I can't put my finger on it. I feel like
I wander around looking for what I need to know. Think I found it, wait that's
not it, this is it. But what makes OpenBSD, the plantonic ideal of documentation
quality, so nice? I thought about it and can list a few qualities.

- Chunked up into small sections
    - This is a half a formatting gripe. But I really like that families of
      related functions are put on their own page, with it meant to be read as a
      stand alone document. And links to other families of related functions for
      further reading. It makes getting information much faster. Python on the
      other hand likes to put it all on one page.
- Standard presentation of information (within the same document)
    - Official python docs will change layout from one line to the next!
- Infodump up top, motivation below
    - I like the pattern of function signatures up top, and then a plain
      description of how those functions will interact or be used. You start
      here(), mabye call this(), then once you are ready call work().
